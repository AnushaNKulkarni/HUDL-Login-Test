The dynamic tag testing couldnt be performed as Hudl.com is created with HTML5. 
If a required attribute is placed on a input field, the "Please fill in this field."(default message for required elements/inputs) tooltip will be shown . This tooltip is generated by the browser(Chrome in this case), not the app itself.
